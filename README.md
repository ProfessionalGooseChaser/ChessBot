# ChessBot
This Repo uses the Chess.com Api to get game data over the lifetime of an account. Then using TensorFlow, the repo trains a deep learning model that mimics the play style of the chess.com account.
 
10/6 Edit: I email the developers and there was no way to get around the firewall that blocks my IP after so many requests. So I am downloading my game history onto an external storage device and opening those files that way. This does ultimately limit the applicability of the model. After the project is shown to be successful, I plan to work directly with the developers to develop a way to make this project more successful.
10/11 Update: I finally downloaded my chess games to a thumbdrive.
